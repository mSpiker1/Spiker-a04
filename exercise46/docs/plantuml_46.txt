note right of Histogram::"wordCounter"
method that takes in a string to search

returns an integer equal to how many times
the search string pops up in the arraylist.
end note

note right of Histogram::"histPrint"
method to print the final histogram based
on how many times each word in wordOrder
appears according to numWords.
end note

note right of Solution46::"main"
method that builds the two arrays necessary
for histPrint and calls other functions to
do so, then calls histPrint to generate
the final output to terminal.
